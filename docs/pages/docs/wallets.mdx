# Wallets

Connectors are used to _connect_ the user's wallet to your dapp.
If you dapp requires the user to submit a transaction or sign a message,
you must provide a list of supported wallets to Starknet React.

## Connectors

This in an alphabetical list of connectors supported by Starknet React.

### Injected Connector

An _injected connector_ is a wallet that injects itself in the web page. This
type of wallets are also known as _"browser wallets"_.

Configure a new injected wallet with the following properties:

 - `id` (required): unique wallet id, used when injecting the wallet in the web page.
 - `name` (optional): human friendly name.
 - `icon` (optional): wallet icons, for both light and dark mode. Icons should be base 64
   encoded svg images that developers can use as `src` properties on an `img`
   HTML tag.

### `useInjectedConnectors`

Starknet React provides the `useInjectedConnectors` hook to discover injected
wallets automatically. You can read more about this hook [in the
documentation](/docs/hooks/use-injected-connectors).

### Injected

This helper is useful to create a new connector with the provided id.

```tsx twoslash
import { injected } from "@starknet-react/core";

const connector = injected({ id: "my-wallet" });
```

### Argent X

The Argent X wallet is supported out of the box.

```tsx twoslash
import { argent } from "@starknet-react/core";

const connectors = [
  argent()
];
```

### Braavos

The Braavos wallet is supported out of the box.

```tsx twoslash
import { braavos } from "@starknet-react/core";

const connectors = [
  braavos()
];
```

### Cartridge Controller

The Cartridge Controller wallet is supported however, you need to install the
`@cartridge/connector` package. 

The Controller enables seamless use of Session Keys.

```bash
pnpm i @cartridge/connector
```

```tsx twoslash
import React, { useCallback } from "react";
import { ControllerConnector } from "@cartridge/connector";
import { Connector } from "@starknet-react/core";

const rpc = useCallback(() => {
  return { nodeUrl: 'https://api.cartridge.gg/x/starknet/mainnet' };
}, []);

// Without Session Keys
const connectors = [
  new ControllerConnector({
    rpc: rpc().nodeUrl,
  }) as never as Connector,
];
```


```tsx twoslash
import React, { useCallback } from "react";
import { ControllerConnector } from "@cartridge/connector";
import { Connector } from "@starknet-react/core";

const rpc = useCallback(() => {
  return { nodeUrl: 'https://api.cartridge.gg/x/starknet/mainnet' };
}, []);

// With Session Keys // [!code focus]
const connectors = [// [!code focus]
  new ControllerConnector({// [!code focus] 
    rpc: rpc().nodeUrl, // [!code focus]
    policies:[ // [!code focus]
      { // [!code focus]
        target: "0x3f96056436be253753351fe689110ced7d53f5db3fd98f13df3f19058311b95", // [!code focus]
        method: "create", // [!code focus]
      }, // [!code focus]
    ], // [!code focus] 
  }) as never as Connector,// [!code focus]
];// [!code focus]
```
